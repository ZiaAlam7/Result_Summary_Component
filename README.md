## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

I know how to work with React.js but in this specific project I didn't used it but instead tried to work with Direct DOM maniplation using Vanilla JS.

The tricky part of this project was the CSS like the two card one blue and one white the purple have all rounded corners but the white has only two rounded corners to the right and you can see the light shadow around the white card that extends to thr blue card, so in order to do that I had to put and another div behind the two cards.

### Continued development

I will be working on polishing and improving my frontend skills
